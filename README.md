# Wordle
This is a word game based off the hit game wordle. It was coded using .NET MAUI and using C#. To play, clone the repo and then hit play. This will work best in Visual Studios on a Windows Computer. Type your guess into the textbox on the right and hit enter. The game has the same rules as Wordle.
